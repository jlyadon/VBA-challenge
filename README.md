# PatternCheck.vb

This script checks to confirm that all stocks were traded on all days. I scrolled down in each quarter's sheet to find the number of days the first stock was traded, then wrote a loop to check that each stock was traded for the same number of days. Having confirmed that, I could assume the pattern in the project code.

# StockDataMacroDraftGen.vb

This file is the code for the subroutine that executes all the steps called for in the project. It can be copied and pasted into Excel and run on the unsolved Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx to replicate my results.

# Module02challenge.xlsm

This is the modified Excel workbook after the code in StockDataMacroDraftGen.vb has been run as Sub StockDataCleanup().
